	InTheBoks - Facebook Authentication Sample

	This is a quick sample that shows how to build an application
	which integrates with the Facebook Developer Platform for user
	authentication.

	The sample has support for multiple languages and will load your
	resource texts onto the web browser, enabling youto easily support
	multiple languages, also on the client.


	Requirements:

		- AppId from Facebook Developer Platform (https://developers.facebook.com)
		- SQL Express
		- MVC 4 RC

	Add the appId to the Scripts/app/fb.js file in the FB.init function call.
	The InTheBoks.Web is configured to run with port 7474, make sure you
	set that URL as the app URL within the Facebook app settings: http://localhost:7474/
